module APN
  # Encapsulates the logic necessary to convert an iPhone token and an array of options into a string of the format required
  # by Apple's servers to send the notification.  Much of the processing code here copied with many thanks from
  # http://github.com/samsoffes/apple_push_notification/blob/master/lib/apple_push_notification.rb
  #
  # APN::Notification.new's first argument is the token of the iPhone which should receive the notification.  The second argument
  # is a hash with any of :alert, :badge, and :sound keys. All three accept string arguments, while :sound can also be set to +true+
  # to play the default sound installed with the application. At least one of these keys must exist.  Any other keys are merged into
  # the root of the hash payload ultimately sent to the iPhone:
  #
  #   APN::Notification.new(token, {:alert => 'Stuff', :custom => {:code => 23}})
  #   # Writes this JSON to servers: {"aps" => {"alert" => "Stuff"}, "custom" => {"code" => 23}}
  # 
  # As a shortcut, APN::Notification.new also accepts a string as the second argument, which it converts into the alert to send.  The 
  # following two lines are equivalent:
  #
  #   APN::Notification.new(token, 'Some Alert')
  #   APN::Notification.new(token, {:alert => 'Some Alert'})
  #
  class Notification
    # Available to help clients determine before they create the notification if their message will be too large.
    # Each iPhone Notification payload must be 256 or fewer characters.  Encoding a null message has a 57 
    # character overhead, so there are 199 characters available for the alert string.
